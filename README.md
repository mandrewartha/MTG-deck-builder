# Magic the Gathering Deck Builder

# Description

Magic the Gathering is a card game based around large decks of cards that include land, creatures, and instant types. The Magic the Gathering Deck Builder site utilizes the MTG API to creature new and random decks for users. Users can filter through by mana type and color and then choose how many of each type of card they want. The site when then pull up a new deck built of an array of card images. Each type of card is grouped together and has it's own color of border to make it easier to differintiate. Users can also save their decks to look at later. 

# Pop up Modal

When you first open the page, a modal pops up so that you can fill in each category and pick your type of deck! The modal can be recalled by pressing the Build a Deck button at the top.
